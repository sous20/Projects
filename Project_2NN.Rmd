```

## Introduction

---

##### The dataset I will be using for this project was compiled using a website dedicated to car auctions called Cars & Bids. Potential customers looking at cars listed on this site have access to plenty of information about each car such as current mileage, transmission type, body style, and more. For my dataset, I will be looking specifically at BMW M3s from 2008 to 2013 that have been auctioned on Cars & Bids. The variables of the dataset will consist of particular pieces of information about each BMW such as those listed previously. To access the site, click on the link below.

##### I picked this dataset to analyze because I am particularly interested in this vehicle, so much so that I plan to buy one in the future. I will be investigating the impact of different factors such as mileage, transmission type, body style, exterior and interior color, and more on the resale value of this specific M3.

## Data Preparation

```{r, echo = FALSE}

#Data Preparation Code (Section 2)

m3_data = read.csv("m3_data.csv") %>% as_tibble()

m3_data$Max.Bid.Price = as.numeric(m3_data$Max.Bid.Price)
m3_data$Mileage = as.numeric(m3_data$Mileage)

#conversion to numeric datatype for future calculations involving decimals

m3_data$Car.Sold = ifelse(m3_data$Car.Sold == "No", 0, 1) %>% as.logical()
m3_data$Competition.Package = ifelse(m3_data$Competition.Package == "No", 0, 1) %>% as.logical()

#conversion to logical datatype to distinguish yes/no variables from character variables

m3_data$Miles.Per.Dollar = round(m3_data$Mileage/m3_data$Max.Bid.Price, digits = 2)
m3_data$Low.Mileage = c(0)
m3_data$Low.Mileage = ifelse(m3_data$Mileage <= 50000, 1, 0) %>% as.logical()

#two new variables - miles/dollar can determine reliability, low mileage can be used for the fill on bivariate graphs for more depth/information 

colnames(m3_data) = c("Model Year", "Max Bid Price", "Car Sold", "Competition Package", "Transmission", "Mileage", "Body Style", "Title Status", "Exterior Color", "Interior Color", "Miles Per Dollar", "Low Mileage")

#column name change makes variable names easier to read

for (i in 1:nrow(m3_data)){
  
  if (m3_data$`Body Style`[i] == "Convertible") m3_data$`Body Style`[i] = paste(m3_data$`Body Style`[i], "(E93)")
  
  if (m3_data$`Body Style`[i] == "Coupe") m3_data$`Body Style`[i] = paste(m3_data$`Body Style`[i], "(E92)")
  
  if (m3_data$`Body Style`[i] == "Sedan") m3_data$`Body Style`[i] = paste(m3_data$`Body Style`[i], "(E90)")
  
}

#adds formal m3 model names - e93 is convertible, e92 is coupe, e90 is sedan. Info added to help viewer identify specific body style if only given e9x value.

```

---

##### I obtained my data by manually inputting each observation into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet before converting it to a CSV file and importing it into R. This method was extremely inefficient, but due to technical difficulties I was not able to scrape my data using the selector gadget. 

<br>

##### Once I imported the data, the following measures were taken to process it:

<br>

##### - I converted the max bid and mileage columns from integer variables to numeric variables to make future numerical manipulation involving decimals smoother. 

##### - I changed the Car Sold and Competition Package variables to logical variables since they were initally imported as character variables. 

##### - I created two new variables called Miles per Dollar and Low Mileage. 

##### - I renamed all of the variables in the dataset because each variable that had multiple words was initially separated by a period. This makes the variables easier to read.

##### - I utilized a for loop to add each formal M3 model indicator to the Body Style Variable. E93 refers to convertible, E92 refers to coupe, and E90 refers to sedan. See Section 7 for reasoning.

<br>

##### As mentioned above, one challenge I had was that I could not scrape my data so I inputted each observation into my dataset manually. This took a long time and increased the risk for mistakes. As for NA values, there was only one such occurrence where an auction had been cancelled. I dealt with this by simply removing it from the dataset, which left me with `r nrow(m3_data)` total observations.

## Variable Descriptions

```{r}

#Variable Descriptions Code (Section 3)

m3_variables = c("Max Bid Price", "Car Sold", "Transmission", "Mileage", "Body Style", "Miles Per Dollar", "Low Mileage") #variables of interest

data_type = c(class(m3_data$`Max Bid Price`), class(m3_data$`Car Sold`), class(m3_data$Transmission), class(m3_data$Mileage), class(m3_data$`Body Style`), class(m3_data$`Miles Per Dollar`), class(m3_data$`Low Mileage`))

#datatypes of variables of interest

var_desc = c("Maximum price that a customer bid for the vehicle, regardless of if it sold.", "Whether or not the vehicle sold; whether or not the reserve price was met.", "Type of transmission - either a 6 speed manual or dual clutch 7 speed automatic.", "Amount of miles the vehicle has on the odometer at the time of auction.", "If the vehicle is Coupe, Convertible, or Sedan.", "Amount of miles driven for every dollar bid on the vehicle.", "Vehicles with under 50,000 miles.") #variable descriptions

m3_var = tibble(Variables = m3_variables, Data_Type = str_to_title(data_type), Variable_Description = var_desc)

colnames(m3_var) = c("Variables", "Data Type", "Variable Description")

```

---

##### Below is a table with the name, type, and brief description of each variable of interest from the original M3 dataset.

---

```{r}

m3_var %>% kbl(caption = "M3 Data Variables") %>% kable_material("striped")

```

---

## Univariate Analyses

---

```{r}

uni_function = function(uni_variable, var_name){
  
  if (class(uni_variable) == "numeric") print(ggplot(m3_data) + geom_histogram(aes(x = uni_variable), color = "black", fill = "aquamarine", bins = 15) + labs(title = paste("Distribution of M3s by", var_name), x = var_name, y = "Count"))
  
  else if (class(uni_variable) == "character") print(ggplot(m3_data) + geom_bar(aes(x = uni_variable), color = "black", fill = "skyblue", width = 0.3) + labs(title = paste("Distribution of M3s by", var_name), x = var_name, y = "Count"))
    
}

#function above takes in a specific variable of interest. if variable is numeric, graph will be a histogram. if variable is character, graph will be bar plot.

uni_function(uni_variable = m3_data$`Max Bid Price`, var_name = "Max Bid Price")

```

---

##### The graph above deals with the Max Bid Price variable, which is skewed heavily to the right with a long tail towards the highest values. The mean value for this variable is $`r mean(m3_data$"Max Bid Price") %>% format(., scientific = FALSE)`, with standard deviation from the mean being $`r sd(m3_data$"Max Bid Price") %>% format(., scientific = FALSE)`. These descriptive statistics demonstrate that the resale price of these M3s are often cheaper than new cars today, and they underscore the instances in which an M3 from this time period sells for over $50000.

---

```{r}

uni_function(uni_variable = m3_data$Mileage, var_name = "Mileage")

```

---

##### The graph above deals with the Mileage variable, which is also skewed heavily to the right with a long tail towards the highest values. The mean value for this variable is `r mean(m3_data$Mileage) %>% format(., scientific = FALSE)` miles, with a standard deviation from the mean being `r sd(m3_data$Mileage) %>% format(., scientific = FALSE)` miles. These descriptive statistics demonstrate a wide range of possible mileages that an M3 from this time could have, indicating that some previous owners may look after their M3s more by driving it less, while others use it as a daily vehicle. 

---

```{r}

uni_function(uni_variable = m3_data$Transmission, var_name = "Transmission")

auto = filter(m3_data, m3_data$Transmission == "Automatic")

manual = filter(m3_data, m3_data$Transmission == "Manual")

#these subsets allow me to find the number of each type of transmission and input them into inline code. they also allow me to create five number summaries for max bid price relating to transmission type. 

```

---

##### The graph above deals with the Transmission variable, which is not particularly skewed in any direction as the number of M3s auctioned with an automatic transmission was highly similar to the number of M3s auctioned with a manual transmission. However, we can see that cars with an automatic transmission were auctioned slightly more (maximum value), with `r nrow(auto)` being exact the amount. Cars with a manual transmission (minimum value) were auctioned `r nrow(manual)` times. This distribution demonstrates that the choice of transmission is highly dependent on the preference of the buyer.  

---

```{r}

uni_function(uni_variable = m3_data$`Body Style`, var_name = "Body Style")

conv = filter(m3_data, m3_data$`Body Style` == "Convertible (E93)")

coupe = filter(m3_data, m3_data$`Body Style` == "Coupe (E92)")

sedan = filter(m3_data, m3_data$`Body Style` == "Sedan (E90)")

#these subsets allow me to find the number of each body type and input them into inline code. they also allow me to create five number summaries for max bid price relating to each body type. 

```

---

##### The graph above deals with the Body Style variable, which is slightly skewed to the right. The most prevalent body style was the two door Coupe (maximum value), with `r nrow(coupe)` instances in the dataset. The least prevalent body style was the four door Sedan (minimum value), with `r nrow(sedan)` instances in the dataset. Two door convertibles (median) fell right into between the other two body styles, with `r nrow(conv)` instances in the dataset. After observing this graph, it is clear that the two door options are more popular than the four door sedan.

---

## Multivariate Analyses

---

```{r}

ggplot(m3_data) + geom_point(aes(x = Mileage, y = `Max Bid Price`), color = "blue")

```

---

##### The graph above displays an inverse relationship between the mileage of an M3 and its Maximum Bid Price. Besides one outlier that was bid for past $80,000, this trend was extremely consistent. The correlation coefficient between these two variables is `r cor(m3_data$Mileage, m3_data$"Max Bid Price") %>% round(., digits = 2)`, which indicates a strong negative correlation.

---

```{r}

ggplot(m3_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Transmission, y = `Max Bid Price`)) + geom_point(aes(x = Transmission, y = `Max Bid Price`, color = `Low Mileage`), position = "jitter")

#boxplot combined with scatter plot (jitter) to show in depth distribution of points

```

---

##### The graph above displays the distribution of max bid prices by transmission. It also further organizes the data by whether or not the vehicles had under 50000 miles on the odometer. Disregarding the outlier for the manual transmission boxplot, the distribution of points are extremely similar, signaling no real correlation between max bid price and transmission type. Below are five number summaries for automatic and manual transmissions respectively.

<br>

```{r}

fivenum(auto$`Max Bid Price`) %>% round(., digits = 0)

fivenum(manual$`Max Bid Price`) %>% round(., digits = 0)

```

---

```{r}

ggplot(m3_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = `Body Style`, y = `Max Bid Price`)) + geom_point(aes(x = `Body Style`, y = `Max Bid Price`, color = `Low Mileage`), position = "jitter")

#boxplot combined with scatter plot (jitter) to show in depth distribution of points

```

---

##### The graph above displays the distribution of max bid prices by body style. It also further organizes the data by whether or not the vehicles had under 50000 miles on the odometer. By observing the graph, it is clear that on average the coupe body style received the highest maximum bids, many of which were higher than some convertible and sedan M3s with considerably lower mileages. Below are five number summaries for convertible, coupe, and sedan body styles respectively.

<br>

```{r}

fivenum(conv$`Max Bid Price`) %>% round(., digits = 0)

fivenum(coupe$`Max Bid Price`) %>% round(., digits = 0)

fivenum(sedan$`Max Bid Price`) %>% round(., digits = 0)

```

---

```{r}

ggplot(m3_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = `Car Sold`, y = `Miles Per Dollar`)) + geom_point(aes(x = `Car Sold`, y = `Miles Per Dollar`), color = "blue", position = "jitter")

#boxplot combined with scatter plot (jitter) to show in depth distribution of points

```

---

```{r}

car_sold = filter(m3_data, `Car Sold` == TRUE)

car_not_sold = filter(m3_data, `Car Sold` == FALSE)

#these subsets allow me to create five number summaries for miles per dollar relating to whether or not the car was sold.

```

##### The graph above displays the distribution of miles the car has driven per dollar (mileage/max bid price) by whether or not the car sold. Looking at the graph, there were clearly more cars that sold than not, but their distributions in terms of miles per dollar were about the same. The miles per dollar variable measures potential reliability, as a customer looking at an M3 with a higher miles per dollar would be receiving a vehicle that has proven to last longer for a price similar to that of other vehicles with lower mileages. With this data, we can see that most M3s had around 2-3 miles driven per dollar. Below are five number summaries for cars that sold and cars that did not sell, respectively.

<br>

```{r}

fivenum(car_sold$`Miles Per Dollar`)

fivenum(car_not_sold$`Miles Per Dollar`)

```

## Reproducibility

---

##### In order to ensure reproducbility of this project, I made sure to make plenty of commentary as I coded. I also made sure to limit the amount of external files one would need to have in their directory to knit the project correctly. As of now, the only files needed are the jpeg for the picture at the beginning of the project and the M3 dataset.

---

## Choice Elements

---

##### For my first choice element, I used more than 5 inline codes throughout the project. The first instance shows up in the data preparation section, where I used inline code to print the number of observations in my initial dataset. The rest of the instances they show up in are the descriptions of multiple univariate and multivariate graphs, where I used them to include specific descriptive statistics.

<br>

##### For my second choice element, I chose to create two new variables of interest. The first variable I chose to create was miles per dollar, which was calculated by dividing a vehicle's mileage by its maximum bid price. As mentioned previously, this variable can hint at potential reliability of a vehicle. The second variable I chose to create was called Low Mileage, which was a logical variable that marked observations true if the vehicle had under 50000 miles, and false otherwise. I used this variable to add depth of information to two of my multivariate graphs.

<br>

##### For my third choice element, I used a loop to add the formal M3 model indicators - E90, E92, and E93 - to their corresponding body types. E90 refers to the sedan body type, E92, refers to the coupe body type, and E93 refers to the convertible body type. This was done in the hopes of eliminating any confusion that might arise if a viewer of the dataset sees these specific indicators online without their corresponding body types.

<br>

##### For my fourth choice element, I wrote a function capable of receiving two arguments that makes graphing numeric and character variables in a univariate manner quicker and easier. All the user has to do is enter the variable they want to graph, as well as the variable name that will be inserted into the title and x - axis label. This function only takes variables that are numeric or character, but the use of if statements allows for endless other graphing options.

<br>

##### For my fifth element which I briefly mentioned in the last paragraph, I used an if statement in my function to graph univariate variables. This allows the user to input variables of different data types, which will be graphed differently depending on the code after each if statement.

---

## Conclusion

---

##### In conclusion, I determined that though there are many various factors that go into purchasing a BMW M3 E9X, only a handful of them truly reflect what specific car to look at. Some of the variables I observed ended up simply being a matter of personal preference, or they just were not factors important enough to most potential buyers.

<br>

##### For example, when looking at the relationship between miles per dollar and whether or not the cars sold, the boxplots turned out to be extremely similar, indicating a lack of customer interest for how many miles a car had driven in comparison to how much they bid. I thought this would have been a much more useful variable in determining reliability of the vehicle. Similarly, when looking at max bid price by transmission, the data did not reflect any major differences in pricing. However, unlike the miles per dollar variable, I expected this was possible as the transmission does not have a large affect on the performance of the vehicle, but rather the feel. 

<br>

##### The two variables of interest that did produce useable results were mileage and body style. When comparing mileage to max bid price, there was a clear negative correlation between the two; as mileage goes up, bid price goes down. For me, this was obviously a result I expected to see. However, I was surprised when comparing body style to max bid prices when I found that coupes were clearly selling for more than sedans and convertibles. I interpreted this to be that most people interested in buying an E9X M3 in today's market are looking for a performance vehicle, which can be achieved best with the E92 coupe.
